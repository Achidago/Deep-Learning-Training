## 1. Land Cover Classification Method 
### 1.1 Supervised and Unsupervised Classification 
**Unsupervised classification** is where the outcomes  are based on the software analysis of an image without the user providing sample classes. The computer uses techniques to determine which pixels are related and groups them into classes. 

**Supervised classification** is based on the idea that a user can select sample pixels in an image that are representative of specific classes and then direct the image processing software to use these training sites as references for the classification of all other pixels in the image. 


### 1.2 Common Classification Algorithms
1. The **Minimum-Distance to the Mean Classifier** is used to classify unknown image data to classes which minimize the distance between the image data and the class in multi-feature space. The distance is defined as an index of similarity so that the minimum distance is identical to the maximum similarity ([1](http://sar.kangwon.ac.kr/etc/rs_note/rsnote/cp11/cp11-6.htm)).
    1. Euclidean distance
    2. Normalized Euclidean distance
    3. Mahalanobis distance 
2. The **Parallelepiped Classifier** uses the class limits and stored in each class signature to determine if a given pixel falls within the class or not. The class limits specify the dimensions (in standard deviation units) of each side of a parallelepiped surrounding the mean of the class in feature space  ([2](http://www.sc.chula.ac.th/courseware/2309507/Lecture/remote18.htm)) .
3. The **Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (GMLC)** quantitatively evaluates both the variance and covariance of the category spectral response patterns when classifying an unknown pixel. It is assumed that the distribution of the cloud of points forming the category training data is Gaussian ([3](http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/water/paper/remotesensing/chapter1.htm)) 
4. The **Random Forest Classifier** is an ensemble learning method that creates a multitude of decision trees and takes the average of the trees for classifcaiton. The RF algorithm can also classify variable importance. 
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers** are a collection of non-parametric learning algorithms which finds the optimal separating hyperplane between classes by focusing on the training data. 
6. **Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC)** is a general-purpose algorithm that evaluates changes in pixel values over time. 

### 1.3 Land Cover Classification Systems 

## 2 Applications in Google Earth Engine 
For this workshop, we will be focusing only on supervised classification methods. In particular, we will be using random forests, SVM, and CCDC in GEE.

Exercise
using excel sheet - add training data using google map; google earth pro
submit this after some time...
we will have to turn it into shp file and give it back to them.
perform classification
qs: report on accuracies/metric; differences in classification;
