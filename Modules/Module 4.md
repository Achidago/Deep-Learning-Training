## 1. Land Cover Classification Method



### 1.1 Supervised image Classification 
**Supervised image classification** is a method for identifying spectrally similar areas on images by first identifying known classes from training sites and then directing the image processing towards those training sites as reference for unknown targets.  

- **Minimum-Distance to the Mean Classifier**: a remote sensing technique used to classify unknown image data to known classes by calculating the mean point in digital parameter space.
   <blockquote> 
   Note: this classifier includes multiple metrics including Euclidean distance, normalized Euclidean distance, and Mahalanobis distance. 
   </blockquote>
  
-  **Parallelepiped Classifier**: uses a decision rule to classify multispectral data by forming a n-dimensional parallelepiped classification in image data space by assigning given pixels to classes based on threshold values. 
- **Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (GMLC)**: quantitatively evaluates both the variance and covariance of the category spectral response patterns when classifying an unknown pixel. It is assumed that the distribution of the cloud of points forming the category training data is Gaussian ([3](http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/water/paper/remotesensing/chapter1.htm)) 
- **Random Forest Classifier**: an ensemble learning method that creates a multitude of decision trees and takes the average of the trees for classifcaiton. The RF algorithm can also classify variable importance. 
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers**: a collection of non-parametric learning algorithms which finds the optimal separating hyperplane between classes by focusing on the training data. 
- **Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC)**: a general-purpose algorithm that evaluates changes in land cover, land use, or condition over time. The algorithm includes a two-step masking algorithm to eliminate any noisy data caused by snow, clouds, or cloud shadows. Classification occurs after change is detected in a pixel value. 

### 1.2 Land Cover Classification Systems 
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is a comprehensive land use and land cover product covering all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The classification scheme developed in this product is primarily based on Landsat satellite data and the product is renewed every 5 years.

  - 52	_Shrub/Scrub_ - areas dominated by shrubs; less than 5 meters tall with shrub canopy typically greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class includes true shrubs, young trees in an early successional stage or trees stunted from environmental conditions. 
 </details>

 <details>
 <summary>Herbaceous</summary>
   
  - 71	_Grassland/Herbaceous_ - areas dominated by gramanoid or herbaceous vegetation, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation. These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be utilized for grazing.
   
  - 72	_Sedge/Herbaceous_ - Alaska only areas dominated by sedges and forbs, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation. This type can occur with significant other grasses or other grass like plants, and includes sedge tundra, and sedge tussock tundra.

  - 82	_Cultivated Crops_ - areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, and also perennial woody crops such as orchards and vineyards.
