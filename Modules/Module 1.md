# Satellite Remote Sensing for Land-Use Planning

## Module 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing 

_Remote sensing is the science and art of obtaining information about an object, area, or phenomenon through the analysis of data acquired by a device that is not in contact with the object, area, or phenomenon under investigation<sup>1</sup>._

Modern day remote sensing started with the advent of radar, sonar, and thermal infrared detection systems during WWII. Since then, detectors have been expanded to  run on most of the EM spectrum and variety of applications spanning from military use to agriculture. 

### 1. EM spectrum 
• **Electromagnetic spectrum** is the entire distribution of electromagnetic radiation according to frequency or wavelength. 

• **Observed energy** or **radiation** is primarily sensitive to molecular resonances in the to molecular resonances in the surface layer surface layer of target. 

• **Emitted**, **reflected**, and **backscattered radiation** is sensitive to temperature distribution, geometric, and electric properties of surface or volume. 

•**Near infrared (NIR)** is defined from 750 nm to 1400 nm and **shortwave infrared (SWIR)** from 1400 nm to 3000 nm.

The human eye is only able to detect wavelengths in the visible light range. However, many insects see in the 300 to 650 nm wavelength and can detect ultraviolet light because   they have special photoreceptors in their eyes.

| Band                         | Wavelength           |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
|     Blue                     |     0.45-0.51µm      |
|     Green                    |     0.53-0.59µm      |
|     Red                      |     0.64-0.67µm      |
|     Near Infrared            |     0.75-1µm         |
|     Short-wave infrared 1    |     1-1.6µm          |
|     Short-wave infrared 2    |     1.6-2.5µm        |
|     Thermal Infrared         |     10.60–12.51µm    |

**1.2 Exercises**

Download the following files and view them in QGIS. 

Start by creating a new project in QGIS. Next add the files by clicking the **Add Raster Layer** icon on the lefthand side of the interface. If you dont see the icon, right click the toolbar at the top of the page and make sure **Manage Layers Toolbar** is checked. Once you have added the two files, you should see them added as layer.  

What range of values do you see for the two files?
