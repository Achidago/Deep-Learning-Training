# Module4 - Change Detection Exercise 5

## Description
In this exercise, we will create a time series of landcover estimates across administrative boundaries.

## Skills Developed
- Understand how **pixelArea()** and **reduceRegion()** methods allow the calculation of areas across arbitrary regions.
- Understand differences between **list** and **dictionary** data structures.
- How to use **map()** as a method to iterate over items.

## Instructions
1. In the GEE code editor, copy and paste the script for this exercise, "07_Multiyear_Landcover_Change".
2. Change dates in variable **filtered** to specify period for which results are required. Note MCD12Q1 is avaibale from 2001 to currently 2018.
3. Choose a region of interest from the FAO/GAUL dataset ([link](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_SIMPLIFIED_500m_2015_level2)). Replace 'Ashanti' with your area of interest in variable **Block**.
4. Inspect the results of the operations in the console till line 105. Then run the entire script.
5. Download the results and convert to an excel sheet.
6. Report the landcover type that is changing the most rapidly in your region of interest. Also submit excel sheet.
