# Module4 - Change Detection Exercise 4

## Description
In this exercise, we will conduct a flood damage assessment using the script [06_flood_damage_assessment](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#06_flood_damage_assessment).

## Skills Developed
- Assessing the difference when using different polarization combinations and utilizing radar data from ascending or descending passes.
- Assessing change thresholds by inspecting image histograms.
- Generating a change mask, and utilizing an ancillary dataset to assess the extent of damage.

## Instructions
1. In the GEE code editor, copy and paste the script for this exercise.
2. Select a region of interest based on news or personal information. Change the dates to encompass at least a month of data before, and after the event occurred. 
3. Select the polarization you want to test we utilize VV polarization, but some events may be detected better by HH or VH polarizations. 
4. Select the Ascending or Descending passes. Running this section should tell you if sufficient data are available.
5. Run the rest of the script, use the generated histogram to generate a satisficatory mask, and inspect the map generated.
  When done:<br>

- Describe the event you investigated.<br>
- Describe the parameters you used to conduct the damage assessment.<br>
- Write a couple of sentences on the damage assessment results.<br>
