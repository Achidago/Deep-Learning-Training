# Module 2 - Change Detection Exercise 1

## Description
In this exercise, we will conduct a change detection using GEE with the following "code". Selct an area (region) of interest amd run the analysis.

## Skills Developed
- Introduction to Change Detection
- Change Detection using Remote Sensing
- Change Detection in GEE

## Instructions
1. In the GEE code editor, copy and paste the script for this exercise, "Change_Detection"
2. Adjust the variables "ST_DATE", and "END_DATE" to indicate a time period of interest
3. Choose a region of interest by either drawing a polygon to automatically import a geometry or by manually specifying the Longitue_Min, Latitude_Min, LongitudeMax, and LatitudeMax as coordinates of a rectangle.
4. Run the script over the chosen region and time period: <br>
  a. Describe the process you used for the change detection <br>
  b. Interpret the results <br>
