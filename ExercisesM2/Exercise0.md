# Module4 - Module 0 Exercise 

## Description
In this exercise, you would select two images in different time ranges, study each and compare them.

## Skills Developed
- Learn about remote sensing (RS) systems and datasets
- Become familiar with Google Earth Engine
- Learn about commonly used RS indices and environmental variables
- Interpret the chnages from different Images from different years

## Instructions
In this exercise, we will be using the [
- Create a geometry in an area of interest 

- Two start and end dates will be defined for this exercise: one in the range of 2000-2001, and the other in the range of 2020-2021. 

- Image collections of Landsat 5, 7, 8 are defined 

- Each image collection is filtered by time range, geometry, and cloud cover less than 70%, and the median image of the collection is extracted 

- Visual parameters are defined for the image collections, and the available median images are shown on the map 

The code must be run twice, with screenshots taken of each image output. In each run, the only variable changed will be the time range.
