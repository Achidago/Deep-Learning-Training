# Module4 - Module 0 Exercise 

## Description
In this exercise, you would select two images in different time ranges, study each and compare them.

## Skills Developed
- Learn about remote sensing (RS) systems and datasets
- Become familiar with Google Earth Engine
- Learn about commonly used RS indices and environmental variables
- Interpret the chnages from different Images from different years

## Instructions
In this exercise, we will be using this code [Exercise0_Script](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#08_exercise_0). Open in Google Earth Engine and follow the instructions below;

1. Create a geometry in an area of interest (Hint: A developing or changing area where changes have occured over time)

2. Two start and end dates will be defined for this exercise: one in the range of **2004-2005**, and the other in the range of 2020-2021. (Hint: Choose dates ranging from November-March for higher chances of getting for low cloud images.

- Image collections of Landsat 5, 7, 8 are defined 

- Each image collection is filtered by time range, geometry, and cloud cover less than 70%, and the median image of the collection is extracted 

- Visual parameters are defined for the image collections, and the available median images are shown on the map 

3. The code should be run twice for the different time periods, with screenshots taken of each image output. In each run, the only variable changed will be the date range.

4.  Discuss changes as seen from the two images (before and after) and suggest reasons for these changes.
