## Goal
The fourth GALUP workshop aims at applying skills learned in the second workshop -Introduction to Remote Sensing using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for further analysis. The participants will learn basics in Time Series Analysis and Change Detection and apply this to land use studies and analysis. This workshop is the second phase toward understanding how RS data can be used for land-use assessments.

## Objectives
- Time Series Analysis <br>
- Land cover change detection <br>
- Advanced spatial analysis <br>

## Assignment Submission and Help

The participants will have to sign into their GitHub accounts to submit assignments. Below is a video explaining how to submit the module assignments and how to request help through GitHub. Note: It may be convenient to open videos in the workshop in a new tab or window to easily navigate the GitHub page.
