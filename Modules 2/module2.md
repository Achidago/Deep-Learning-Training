# Module 2 - Convolutional Neural Network

# Overview
- **What is CNN?**: A Convolutional Neural Network is a type of deep learning model specialized for processing grid-like data structures, particularly images. It is widely used in image recognition, object detection, video analysis, and other fields involving visual data.
- **Key Components of CNNs**: <br>
   a. **Filters**: A filter is designed to detect a specific feature in the data, such as a vertical or horizontal edge, a corner, or a texture.
   b. **Stride and Padding**: Stride determines the step size of the filter across the input. Padding maintains spatial dimensions by adding zeros around the edges of the input.
- **Advantages of CNNs over ANNs**:
  a. CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies, recognizing complex patterns.
  b. CNNs share weights, significantly reducing parameters compared to fully connected layers.


**What will you learn from this module?**
- Introduction to change detection using remote sensing,
- Different ways change can be detected, choosing the best sensor combinations,
- Conducting change detection in GEE using a few common examples.

<sub> Healthy vegetation has a large peak in the near infrared region, while soil or burned areas are much lower. Healthy vegetation also has low reflectance in the red and shortwave infrared regions in contrast with burned areas.</sub>
