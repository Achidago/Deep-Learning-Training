# Module 2 - Convolutional Neural Network

# Overview
- **What is CNN?**: A Convolutional Neural Network is a type of deep learning model specialized for processing grid-like data structures, particularly images. It is widely used in image recognition, object detection, video analysis, and other fields involving visual data.
- **Key Components of CNNs**: <br>
   a. **Filters**: A filter is designed to detect a specific feature in the data, such as a vertical or horizontal edge, a corner, or a texture.
   b. **Stride and Padding**: Stride determines the step size of the filter across the input. Padding maintains spatial dimensions by adding zeros around the edges of the input.
- **Advantages of CNNs over ANNs**:
  a. CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies, recognizing complex patterns.
  b. CNNs share weights, significantly reducing parameters compared to fully connected layers.
