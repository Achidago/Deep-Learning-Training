**What will you learn from this module?**

## 1. Spatiotemporal Time Series 

**Spatial/geospatial data** is information about locations and shapes of objects in a geographic coordinate system and is represented as shapes in the form of points, paths and surfaces. **Temporal data** is data that represents a state in time. 


GIS data files usually represent:
– Geospatial features (points, lines, shapes, ...)
– Attributes (population, name, ...)
– Meta-data (datum, projection, ...)
– Display information (color, line styles, ...)

Types of GIS data:
– Raster format data
– Vector format data

Spatio-temporal databases host data collected across both space and time that describe a phenomenon in a particular location and period of time. Applications for spatio-temporal data analysis include the study of biology, ecology, meteorology, medicine, transportation and forestry.
