# Module 1 - Time Series Analysis 


**What will you learn from this module?**

## 1. Introduction to Time Series Analysis
**Time series analysis** looks at landscape change as a dynamic process over several months, years, etc. Mapping the environment at various timescales can provide information about land monitoring parameters like land cover change trends and patterns in vegetation growth. Time series of satellite observations are used to derive environmental parameters to evaluate environmental conditions. <br>

**Common uses for a time series approach include:**
- Identifying urban expansion
- Land Cover changes
- Mapping deforestation
- Monitoring post-fire conditions

- Images should be collected at same time of day and same month or season to avoid seasonal/phenological differences 
- Seasonal trends result from differences in precipitation and temperature

## 2. Spatiotemporal Time Series 
- **Spatial/geospatial data** is information about locations and shapes of objects in a geographic coordinate system and is represented as shapes in the form of points, paths and surfaces. <br>
- **Temporal data** is data that represents a state in time. <br>
- **Spatio-temporal** databases host data collected across both space and time that describe a phenomenon in a particular location and period of time. 

## 3. Time Series Analysis in GEE

GEE has a variety of functions useful for time series analysis:
- filtering and compilation of data across large datasets over time
- analysis using map visualizations and user interface generated charts and graphs
