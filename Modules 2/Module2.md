# Module 2 - Change Detection


**What will you learn from this module?**
- Introduction to Change Detection
- Change Detection using Remote Sensing
- Change Detection in GEE

## 1. Introduction to Change Detection
**Change Detection** Is the conversion of a landscape from one dominant feature type to another. Changes could be observed in the shape or size of patches of land cover, timing of the seasonal processes or the pace of conversion to other cover types. Examples include;
- Land degradation as a result of grazing
- Changes in tree cover due to wildfire or deforestation
- Urbanization

**Change Detection answers the questions;**
- How much and what kind of change has occurred?
- Where and when has change taken place?
- What are the trends in the change?

**Forms of Change;**
- Directional change. E.g Urban development/growth direction
- Cyclic change. E.g Seasonal phenology
- Multidirectional change. E,g Deforestation and forest regeneration

## 2. Change Detection Using Remote Sensing
Changes in the landscape are detected as changes in the spectral values of pixels. We can use spectral signatures to differentiate between cover types and calculate environmental indices. For example, healthy vegetation has high reflectance in the green and near-infrared but low in the short-wave infrared while burned areas have low reflectance in the green and near-infrared but high in the S short-wave infrared. Note, Change detetcion is only possible if time series data is available  to compare changes to cover types and features.
