This example has been conducted using the script ['02_image_indices_environmental_data'](https://github.com/SERVIR-WA/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#02_image_indices_environmental_data) from GEE. A region in Colorado was used as the area of study over the time period: January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. The screenshots of the LST, SRTM elevation, index, and Landsat image are provided as a sample of how the results of Module 3 exercise 1 should appear.
