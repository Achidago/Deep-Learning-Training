# Module-3 Exercise 1
## Description
In this exercise, we will analyze temporal trends of NDVI in different areas using time-series data from Landsat.

## Skills Developed
- Use graphing techniques available in GEE
- Perform spatial and temporal analysis of indices 
- Understand NDVI and its uses

## Instructions
1. Using the script ["05_time_series"](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#05_time_series), alter the variables "ST_DATE" and "END_DATE" to indicate period of interest (e.g. 1-2 years).
2. You will examine three regions. These regions are designated by pre-specified coordinates in the script labeled with four corners of a rectangle (e.g. Longitue_Min1,Latitude_Min1,LongitudeMax1,LatitudeMax1). 
:pushpin: To examine one region at a time, comment out the coordinates for the other two regions (i.e. two of variables of "REG_GH") with "//" and keep the variable for the region of interest uncommented.
3. Run the script, and for each region, take a screenshot of the time-series graph of NDVI values over the course of the given time period within the specified region.
4. Download this document [template](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/files/7516603/WS2_M3E1_Template.docx) and add screenshots of the three graphs, one for each region, as well as the answers to the follwing questions:<br>
    a. Do you notice any distinct patterns in NDVI values over the course of the year(s)? <br>
    b. What is the minimum value of NDVI over the time-period? <br>
    c. What is the maximum value of NDVI over the time-period? <br>
    d. What differences do you notice in NDVI among the three regions? <br>
5.
