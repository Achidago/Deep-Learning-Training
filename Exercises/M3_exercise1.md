# Module-3 Exercise 1
## Description
In this exercise, we will analyze temporal trends of NDVI in different areas using time-series data from Landsat.

## Skills Developed
- Use graphing techniques available in GEE
- Perform spatial and temporal analysis of indices 
- Understand NDVI and its uses

## Instructions
1. Using the script ["05_time_series"](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#05_time_series), alter the variables "ST_DATE" and "END_DATE" to reflect a period of interest (try 1-2 years), and there will be three regions of interest to examine.
2. These regions will be designated by pre-set coordinates in the script labeled with four corners of a rectangle (e.g. xMin1,yMin1,xMax1,yMax1). However, you must comment out whichever two variables of "REG_GH" you do not want to analyze during a trial with "//" and keep the variable of interest for that region's trial.
3. Run the script, and for each region, take a screenshot of the time-series graph of NDVI values over the course of the given time period within the specified region.
4. Download this document [template](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/files/7516603/WS2_M3E1_Template.docx) and add screenshots of your three graphs as well as the answers to the follwing questions:<br>
    a. Do you notice any distinct patterns in NDVI levels over the course of the year(s)? <br>
    b. What differences do you notice in NDVI between the regions? <br>
5. Once completed, submit the document <a href="https://github.com/ecodyn/GALUP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=exercise+w2m2&template=w2m2-exercise-submission.md&title=Module+2+exercises+%5Breplace+with+your+name%5D" title="here">here</a>\.
