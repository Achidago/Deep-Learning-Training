# Module-3 Exercise 2
## Description
In this exercise, we will explore different indices available in GEE.

## Skills Developed
- Understand what different indices represent
- Calculate indices and gather desired data
- Interact with downloaded data from GEE

## Instructions
1. From the script ["06_indices_images"](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#06_indices_images), choose two indices and specify them as the variables "IMG1" and "IMG2", respectively.
2. Choose a time period (about 1 year) and a region/geometry (using the polygon tool). <br>
    :pushpin: Tip: Choose a smaller region so that the image is not too large and will take less processing time.<br>
3. Run the script and export the images that show under the "tasks" bar to your Google Drive. The images will be exported as .tif files.
4. Download the images from your Google Drive, and upload the images as rasters into QGIS.
5. Look at the "Properties" of each image, and change the symbology to effectively visualize each index (e.g. green colorbar for NDVI, blue for NDWI, etc.).
6. Take a screenshot of each image in QGIS and add the screenshots to the [template](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/files/7516633/WS2_M3E2_Template.docx).
7. Once completed, submit the document <a href="https://github.com/ecodyn/GALUP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=exercise+w2m2&template=w2m2-exercise-submission.md&title=Module+2+exercises+%5Breplace+with+your+name%5D" title="here">here</a>\.
