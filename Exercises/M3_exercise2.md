# Module-3 Exercise 2
1. From the script ["06_indices_images"](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/wiki/Scripts#06_indices_images), choose two indices and specify them as the variables "IMG1" and "IMG2", respectively.
2. Choose a chosen time period (about 1 year) and over a chosen geometry (using the polygon tool). <br>
    :pushpin: Tip: choose a smaller geometry size so that the image is not too large and will take less processing time.<br>
3. Run the script export the images that show up under the "tasks" bar to Google Drive.
4. Download the images from Google Drive (they should be .tif files), and open QGIS. Upload the images as rasters to QGIS.
5. Look at the "Properties" of each image, and change the symbology to effectively visualize each index (e.g. green colorbar for NDVI, blue for NDWI, etc.).
6. Take a screenshot of each image in QGIS and add the screenshots to the [template](https://github.com/ecodynlab/GALUP/files/7516633/WS2_M3E2_Template.docx)
7. Once completed, submit the document <a href="https://github.com/ecodyn/GALUP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=exercise+w2m2&template=w2m2-exercise-submission.md&title=Module+2+exercises+%5Breplace+with+your+name%5D" title="here">here</a>\.
